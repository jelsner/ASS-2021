## Main take aways from the Syllabus

Lesson Hours: Mon/Wed 9:05 a.m. - 9:55 a.m., Lab Hours: Fri 9:05 a.m. - 9:55 a.m., Student Hours: Mon/Wed 9:55 a.m. - 10:30 a.m. The best way to contact me is through email: <jelsner@fsu.edu>.

This course is a survey of methods used to describe, analyze, and model _spatial_ data using R. Focus is on applications. I emphasize how spatial statistical methods are related through the concept of spatial autocorrelation.

Lessons are presented (and recorded) on Zoom Mondays and Wednesdays. Lab assignments are done on Zoom (no recording) on Fridays without much direct supervision. 

During each lesson I will work through and explain the R code within an `xx-Lesson.Rmd` file. The notes in the files are comprehensive, so you can work through them on your own. The notes are written using the markdown language (I will explain this a bit today). Think of this as a master class in spatial data science using R.

Grades are determined by how well you do on the weekly assignments.

There are many online sites dedicated to all aspects of the R programming language. A list of some of the ones related to spatial analysis and modeling are in Lesson 1.

You should now be set up with R and RStudio. If not, please stay after class today and I will help you. I will spend the first several lessons teaching you how I work with R. For some of you this might be mostly a review. If this is entirely new don't get discouraged. Most of what we will do does not involve complex R syntax.

In this lesson I provide a review (or an introduction) to working with data using functions from the {base} R packages. The {base} R packages are part of the initial installation of R. They form the scaffolding for working in R, but much of what we will do in this class will involve functions from other packages.

The one exception today is that I will introduce functions from the {readr} package (as part of the {tidyverse} set of packages) that simplify importing data into R. These functions are very similar to the corresponding functions in {base} R.

## Data science workflow with R markdown

A scientific paper is advertisement for a claim. But the _proof_ is the procedure that was used to obtain the result. The code is the exact procedure. Code is the recipe for what we did. It is the most efficient way to communicate precisely what was done. Communication to others and to our future self.

When we use a spreadsheet, it's hard to explain to someone precisely what we did. Click here, then right click here, then choose menu X, etc. The words we use to describe these procedures are not standard.  If you've ever made a map using GIS you know how hard it is to make another (even similar one) with a new set of data. Running code with new data is simple. 

Code is an efficient way to communicate because all important information is given as plain text without ambiguity. Being able to code is a key skill for most technical jobs.

The person most likely to reproduce our work a few months later is us. This is especially true for graphs and figures. These often have a finished quality to them as a result of tweaking and adjustments to the details. This makes it hard to reproduce later. The goal is to do as much of this tweaking as possible with the code we write, rather than in a way that is invisible (retrospectively). Contrast editing an image in Adobe Illustrator.

In data science we toggle between:

(1) Writing code: Code to get our data into R, code to look at tables and summary statistics, code to make graphs, code to compute spatial statistics, code to model and plot our results.

(2) Looking at output: Our code is a set of instructions that produces the output we want: a table, a model, or a figure. It is helpful to be able to see that output.

(3) Taking notes: We also write text about what we are doing, why we are doing it, and what our results mean.

To do be efficient we write our code and our comments _together_ in the same file. This is where R markdown comes in (files that end with `.Rmd`). An R markdown file is a plain text document where text (such as notes or discussion) is interspersed with pieces, or chunks, of R code. When we `Knit` this file the code is executed (from the top to the bottom of the file) and the results supplement or replace the code with output. 

The resulting file is converted into a HTML, PDF, or Word document. The text in the markdown file they has simple format instructions. For example, the following symbols are used for emphasis  _italics_, **bold**, and `code font`. When we create a _new_ markdown document in R Studio, it contains a sample example.

Lesson notes for this class are written in text using markdown formatting as needed. Text is interspersed with code. The format for code chunks is
```{r}
# lines of code here
```

Three back-ticks (on a U.S. keyboard, the character under the escape key) followed by a pair of curly braces containing the name of the language we are using. The back-ticks-and-braces part signal that code is about to begin. We write our code as needed, and then end the chunk with a new line containing three more back-ticks. We can use the _Insert_ button above to save time. 

In the markdown file, the lines between the first and second set of back ticks is grayed and a few small icons are noted in the upper-right corner of the grayed area. The green triangle is used to execute the code and either post the results in the console below or in the line below.

When we keep our notes in this way, we are able to see everything together, the code, the output it produces, and our commentary or clarification on it. Also we can turn it into a good-looking document with one click. This is how we will do everything in this course.

For example, select the _Knit_ button above.

Finally, note the _Outline_ button in the upper right corner of the markdown file. We can organize and navigate through the markdown file section by section based on the pound symbol (`#`).

## Working with data using functions from the {base} R packages

Applied spatial statistics is the analysis and modeling of spatial data. To begin our journey we need to know somethings about data objects in R.

Perhaps the most important function is also one of the simplest. The `c()` function creates a 'vector' data object (vector object). The function combines (concatenates) individual data values, where each data value is separated by a comma, into a vector object with a length equal to the number of data values.

Consider a set of hypothetical annual land falling hurricane counts over a ten-year period. In the first year there were two, the next year there were three, and so on.

2  3  0  3  1  0  0  1  2  1

We save these ten values to our working environment by assigning them to an object that we call `counts`. The assignment operator is an equal sign (`<-` or `=`). 
```{r}
counts <- c(2, 3, 0, 3, 1, 0, 0, 1, 2, 1)
```

By clicking on the _Environment_ tab in the upper-right panel we see that the object `counts` with numerical values (`num`) 2 3, etc below word _Values_. We see that the elements are indexed between 1 and 10 (`1:10`).

We print the values to the console by typing the name of the data object.
```{r}
counts
```

When printed to the console, the values are prefaced with a `[1]`. This indicates that the object is a vector and the first element in the vector has a value of 2 (The number immediately to the right of `[1]`).

Note: We can assign and print by wrapping the entire line of code in parentheses.
```{r}
( counts <- c(2, 3, 0, 3, 1, 0, 0, 1, 2, 1) )
```

We can use the arrow keys on our keyboard to retrieve previous commands. Each command is stored in the history file (click on the _History_ tab in the upper-right panel). The up-arrow key moves backwards through the history file. The left and right arrow keys move the cursor along the line.

We then apply functions to the vector data object. A function has a name and parantheses. Inside the parantheses are the function arguments. Many functions have only a single argument like a data vector. Examples include:
```{r}
sum(counts)
length(counts)
sum(counts)/length(counts)
mean(counts)
```

The function `sum()` totals the hurricane counts over all years, `length()` returns the number of elements in the vector. Other functions include `sort()`, `min()`, `max()`, `range()`, `diff()`, and `cumsum()`.

The object `counts` that we created is a vector containing the hurricane data. This means that the elements are ordered. There is a first element, a second element, and so on. This is good for data objects for several reasons.

The hurricane counts have a chronological order: year 1, year 2, etc and we want that ordered reflected in our data object. Also, we would like to be able to make changes to the data values by element. Finally, vectors are mathematical objects so that math operations can be performed on them in a natural way.

For example, math tells us that a scalar multiplied by a vector is a vector where each element of the product has been multiplied by the scalar. The asterisk `*` is used for multiplication.
```{r}
10 * counts
```

Further, suppose `counts` contain the annual landfall count from the first decade of a longer record.  We want to keep track of counts over other decades. This could be done by the following, example.
```{r}
d1 <- counts
d2 <- c(0, 5, 4, 2, 3, 0, 3, 3, 2, 1)
```

Most functions operate on each element of the data vector all at once.
```{r}
d1 + d2
```

The first year of the first decade is added to the first year of the second decade and so on.

What happens if we apply the `c()` function to these two vectors?
```{r}
c(d1, d2)
```

That's correct. We get a vector with elements from both `d1` and `d2` in the order of first the first decade counts and then the second decade counts.

If we are interested in each year's count as a difference from the decade average, we type
```{r}
d1 - mean(d1)
```

In this case a single number (the mean of the first decade) is subtracted from a vector. The result is from subtracting the number from each entry in the data vector.

Suppose we are interested in the variance of the set of landfall counts. The variance is computed as
$$
\hbox{var}(x) = \frac{(x_1 - \bar x)^2 + (x_2 - \bar x)^2 + \cdots + (x_n - \bar x)^2}{n-1} = \frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar x)^2
$$

Although the `var()` function computes this, here we see how to do this using simpler functions. The key is to find the squared differences and then sum.
```{r}
x <- d1
xbar <- mean(x)
x - xbar
(x - xbar)^2
sum((x - xbar)^2)
n <- length(x)
n
sum((x - xbar)^2)/(n - 1)
var(x)
```

Elements in a vector object must all have the same type. This type can be numeric, as in counts, character strings, as in
```{r}
simpsons <- c('Homer', 'Marge', 'Bart', 'Lisa', 'Maggie')
simpsons
```

Character strings are made with matching quotes, either double, `"`, or single, `'`. If we mix types the values will be coerced into a common type, which is usually a character string. Arithmetic operations do not work on character strings.

Returning to the land falling hurricane counts. Now suppose the National Hurricane Center (NHC) reanalyzes a storm, and that the 6th year of the 2nd decade is a 1 rather than a 0 for the number of landfalls. In this case we type:
```{r}
d2[6] <- 1
```

This assigns to the 6th year of the decade a value of one. The assignment to the 6th entry in the vector `d2` is done by referencing the entry with square brackets `[]`. 

It is important to keep this straight: Parentheses `()` are used for functions and square brackets `[]` are used to extract values from vectors (and data frames, arrays, lists, etc).
```{r}
d2
d2[2]
d2[-4]
d2[c(1, 3, 5, 7, 9)]
```

The first line prints all the elements of the vector `df2`. The second prints only the 2nd value of the vector. The third prints all but the 4th value. The fourth prints the values with odd element numbers.

To create structured data, for example the integers 1 through 99 we use the `:` operator.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
1:99
rev(1:99)
99:1
```

The `seq()` function is more general. We specify the sequence interval with the `by =` or `length =` arguments.
```{r}
seq(from = 1, to = 9, by = 2)
seq(from = 1, to = 10, by = 2)
seq(from = 1, to = 9, length = 5)
```

The `rep()` function is to create repetitive sequences. The first argument is a value or vector that we want repeated and the second argument is the number of times we want it repeated.
```{r}
rep(1, times = 10)
rep(simpsons, times = 2)
```

In the second example the vector `simpsons` containing the Simpson characters is repeated twice.

To repeat each element of the vector use the `each =` argument.
```{r}
rep(simpsons, each = 2)
```

More complicated patterns can be repeated by specifying pairs of equal length vectors. In this case, each element of the first vector is repeated the corresponding number of times specified by the element in the second vector.
```{r}
rep(c("long", "short"),  times = c(2, 3))
```

To find the maximum number of landfalls in the first decade we type.
```{r}
max(d1)
```

What years had the maximum?
```{r}
d1 == 3
```

Notice the double equals signs (`==`).  This is a logical operator that tests each value in `d1` to see if it is equal to 3. The 2nd and 4th values are equal to 3 so `TRUE`s are returned. 

Think of this as asking R a question. Is the value equal to 3?  R answers all at once with a vector of `TRUE`'s and `FALSE`'s.

What years had fewer than 2 hurricanes?
```{r}
d1 < 2
```

Now the question is how do we get the vector element corresponding to the `TRUE` values?  That is, which years have 3 landfalls?
```{r}
which(d1 == 3)
```

The function `which.max()` can be used to get the first maximum.
```{r}
which.max(d1)
```

We might also want to know the total number of landfalls in each decade and the number of years in a decade without a landfall. Or how about the ratio of the mean number of landfalls over the two decades.
```{r}
sum(d1)
sum(d2)
sum(d1 == 0)
sum(d2 == 0)
mean(d2)/mean(d1)
```

So there are 85% more landfalls during the second decade. Is this difference statistically significant?

To remove an object from the environment use the `rm()` function.
```{r}
rm(d1, d2)
```

## Data frames

The data frame is the most important data object in this course. A data frame stores data in a tabular format like a spreadsheet. It is a list of vectors each with the same length. It has column names (and sometimes row names).

For example, we create a data frame object `df` containing three vectors `n`, `s`, `b` each with three elements using the `data.frame()` function.
```{r}
n <- c(2, 3, 5) 
s <- c("aa", "bb", "cc") 
b <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE) 

df <- data.frame(n, s, b)
```

To see that the object is a data frame we use the `class()` function with the name of the object inside the parentheses. 
```{r}
class(df)
```

The object `df` is of class `data.frame`. Note that the object name shows up in our _Environment_ under _Data_ and it includes a little blue arrow indicating that we can view it by clicking on the row.

The data frame shows up as a table (like a spreadsheet) in the `View()` mode (see the command in the console below). Caution: This is not advised for large data frames. The top line of the table is called the header. Each line below the header contains a row of data, which begins with the name (or number) of the row followed by the data values. 

Each data element is in a cell. To retrieve a data value from a cell, we enter its row and column coordinates in that order in the single square bracket `[]` operator and separated by a column.

Here is the cell value from the first row, second column of `df`.
```{r}
df[1, 2]
```

We can print the column names (located in the top row in the `View()` mode)  with the `names()` function.
```{r}
names(df)
```

The list of names is a vector of length three containing the elements "n", "s", and "b" in that order. 

We access individual columns of a data frame as vectors by appending the dollar sign (`$`) to the object name. For example, to print the values of the column labeled `s` we type
```{r}
df$s
```

Base R and many of the packages we will use this semester include example data frames. The data frame called `mtcars`, for instance, contains information extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, and comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973–74 models).
```{r}
class(mtcars)

names(mtcars)
```

The number of data rows and data columns in the data frame are printed using the `nrow()` and `ncol()` functions.
```{r}
nrow(mtcars)
ncol(mtcars)
```

Further details of built-in data frames like `mtcars` is available in the R documentation accessed with the `help()` (or `?`) function.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
help(mtcars)
```

If we type the name of the data frame in the console (this is not advisable!) all the data are printed. 
```{r}
mtcars
```

Instead, to get a glimpse of our data we used the functions `head()`, which prints the first six rows, or `str()`, which lists all the columns by data type. 
```{r}
head(mtcars)

str(mtcars)
```

Consider another built-in data frame called `studentdata` from the {LearnBayes} package. First, install the package with the `install.packages()` function. Put the name of the package {LearnBayes} in quotes (single or double). Then to make the functions available use the `library()` function.
```{r}
if(!require(LearnBayes)) install.packages(pkgs = "LearnBayes", repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")

library(LearnBayes)
```

Note: When using RStudio we don't need to set up our CRAN repository. It is done automatically. This is only for interactive use and not when we use the `Knit` button. We don't want to install packages that already exist on our computer so we add the conditional `if()` function that says "only install the package IF it is not (`!`) available.

Next, make a copy of the data frame and call it `df`. Then print the first six rows using the `head()` function.
```{r}
df <- studentdata
head(df)
```

Data frames are like spreadsheets with rows and columns. The rows are the observations (here each row is a student in an intro stats class at Bowling Green State University) and the columns are the variables. Variables are answers to questions like what is your height?, Choose a number between 1 and 10, Give the time you went to bed last night, etc. 

The names of the columns are available with the `names()` function.
```{r}
names(df)
```

All columns are of the same length, but not all students answered all questions.

We specify particular data elements of the matrix using the bracket notation [row, column] where row is the row number and column is the column number. For example here we specify all the data values in the 10th row.
```{r}
df[10, ]
```

Drink preference was one of the questions. The responses are available in the column labeled `Drink` as a vector of character values. So we list all the drink preferences by typing
```{r}
df$Drink
```

Note that some students left that response blank. These are coded in the data frame as `NA`.

The variable type depends on the question asked. For example, answers given to the question of student height result in a numeric variable, answers given to the question about drink preference result in a character variable.

For integer, character, and factor variables we can summarize the values with the `table()` function.
```{r}
table(df$Drink)
```

There are 113 students who chose milk, 178 choose pop, and 355 chose water. 

We use the `plot()` method to make a quick plot of this table.
```{r}
plot(x = df$Drink)
```

Note that the sum of the responses is `r sum(table(df$Drink))`, which is less than the total number of students (`r nrow(df)`). Note: Here I use inline R code using single back ticks.

Students who left that question blank are ignored. To include the missing values we add the argument `useNA = "ifany"` to the `table()` function.
```{r}
table(df$Drink,
      useNA = "ifany")
```

Suppose we are interested in examining how long students slept. This was not asked directly. We compute it from the `ToSleep` and `WakeUp` times columns. We assign the result of the difference to a column we call `SleepHrs`.
```{r}
df$SleepHrs <- df$WakeUp - df$ToSleep
head(df)
```

Now we have a new numeric variable in the data frame called `SleepHrs`.

We can't table numeric variables, but the `summary()` method provides a set of summary statistics for the values.
```{r}
summary(df$SleepHrs)
```

The average number of hours slept is 7.4 with a maximum of 12.5 and a minimum of 2.5. There are four students that did not answer either when they went to sleep or when they woke up. 

We use the `hist()` function to construct a histogram of sleep hours.
```{r}
hist(x = df$SleepHrs)
```

The histogram function divides the number of sleep hours into one-hour bins and counts the number of students whose computed number of sleep hours falls into each bin. For example based on when they said they went to sleep and when the said they woke up, about 100 students slept between five and six hours the night before the survey.

Since the gender of each student is reported, we can make comparisons between those who identify as male and those who identify as female. For instance, do men sleep more than women? We can answer this question graphically with box plots.
```{r}
plot(x = df$Gender, 
     y = df$SleepHrs)
```

Very little difference.

Repeat for hair cut prices.
```{r}
plot(x = df$Gender, 
     y = df$Haircut)
```

Big difference.

Finally, is the amount of sleep for a student related to bedtime?
```{r}
plot(x = df$ToSleep,
     y = df$SleepHrs)
```

The `ToSleep` variable is centered on midnight so that -2 means they went to sleep at 10p.

We describe the decreasing relationship with a line through the points. The least-squares line is fit using the `lm()` function and the line is drawn on the existing plot with the `abline()` function applied to the linear regression object `model`.
```{r}
model <- lm(SleepHrs ~ ToSleep, 
            data = df)

plot(x = df$ToSleep,
     y = df$SleepHrs)
abline(model)
```

### Past tornadoes in the United States

Most of the time we need to import our data into R. If possible, secondary source data should be imported directly from repositories on the Web. When there is no API (application programming interface) to the repository we need to first download the data.

For example, consider the regularly updated reports of tornadoes in the United States. The data repository is the Storm Prediction Center (SPC) https://www.spc.noaa.gov/wcm/index.html#data.

Here we are interested in the file called `1950-2019_actual_tornadoes.csv`. First we download the file from the site with the `download.file()` function specifying the location (`url =`) and a name we want the file to be called on our computer (`destfile =`).
```{r}
download.file(url = "http://www.spc.noaa.gov/wcm/data/1950-2019_actual_tornadoes.csv",
              destfile = "Tornadoes.csv")
```

A file called `Tornadoes.csv` should now be located in our list of files under the _Files_ tab in the lower-right panel.

Then we read (import) the file into R as a data frame using the `read_csv()` function from the {tidyverse} group of packages. 
```{r}
if(!require(tidyverse)) install.packages(pkgs = "tidyverse", repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")

library(tidyverse)

Torn.df <- read_csv(file = "Tornadoes.csv")
```

We preview the data frame using the `head()` function.
```{r}
head(Torn.df)
```

Each row is a unique tornado report. Observations for each report include the day and time, the state (`st`), the maximum EF rating (`mag`), the number of injuries (`inj`), the number of fatalities (`fat`), estimated property losses (`loss`), estimated crop losses (`closs`), start and end locations in decimal degrees longitude and latitude, length of the damage path in yards (`len`), width of the damage path in miles (`wid`).

The total number of tornado reports in the data set is returned from the `nrow()` function.
```{r}
nrow(Torn.df)
```

To create a subset of the data frame that contains only tornadoes in years (`yr`) since 2001, we include the logical operator `yr >= 2001` inside the subset operator. The logical operator is placed in front of the comma since we want all _rows_ where the result of the operator returns a value `TRUE`.
```{r}
Torn2.df <- Torn.df[Torn.df$yr >= 2001, ]
```

We see that there are fewer rows (tornado reports) in this new data frame assigned the object name `Torn2.df`.

We subset again, keeping only tornadoes with EF ratings (`mag` variable) greater than zero. Here we _recycle_ the name `Torn2.df`.
```{r}
Torn2.df <- Torn.df[Torn.df$mag > 0, ]
```

Now we compute the correlation between EF rating (`mag`) and path length (`len`) with the `cor()` function. The first argument is the vector of EF ratings and the second argument is the vector of path lengths.
```{r}
cor(Torn2.df$mag, Torn2.df$len)
```

Path length is recorded in miles and path width in yards. To convert them to meters and add the converted values as new columns, type
```{r}
Torn2.df$Length <- Torn2.df$len * 1609.34
Torn2.df$Width <- Torn2.df$wid * .9144
```

Create side-by-side box plots of path length (in kilometers) by EF rating.
```{r}
plot(x = factor(Torn2.df$mag), 
     y = Torn2.df$Length/1000)
```

### Past hurricanes in the United States 

Here we load data directly from the Web by specifying the URL as a character string using the `file =` argument.
```{r}
USHur.df <- read_table(file = "http://myweb.fsu.edu/jelsner/temp/data/US.txt")
```

The `dim()` function returns the size of the data frame defined as the number of rows and the number of columns.
```{r}
dim(USHur.df)
```

There are 166 rows and 6 columns in the data frame. Each row is a year and the columns include `Year`, number of hurricanes (`All`), number of major hurricanes (`MUS`), number of Gulf coast hurricanes (`G`), number of Florida hurricanes (`FL`), and number of East coast hurricanes (`E`) in that order. 

To get a glimpse of the data values we list the first six lines of the data frame using the `head()` function.
```{r}
head(USHur.df)
```

The distribution of Florida hurricane counts by year is obtained using the `table()` function and specifying the `FL` column with `df$FL`.
```{r}
table(USHur.df$FL)
```

There are 93 years without a FL hurricane, 43 years with exactly one hurricane, 24 years with two hurricanes, and so on.

Working with data frames using functions from the {base} R packages requires that we understand data frames as list objects. This fact makes these functions harder to learn and to remember. In the next lesson we will see a more formalized way to work with data frames.
