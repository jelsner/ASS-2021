**1** The file `http://myweb.fsu.edu/jelsner/temp/data/police.zip` contains demographic information at the county level across the state of Mississippi.

(a) Import the data as a simple features spatial object and assign it to an object called `PE.sf`. Set the CRS to 4326 using the `set_set_crs()` function. (5)

(b) Using the simple feature data frame `PE.sf` from part (a), create a choropleth map of the percentage of people unemployed in 1980 (variable name `UNEMP`) using functions from the {tmap} package. (5)

(c) Using the simple feature data frame `PE.sf` from part (a), create a choropleth map of the percentage of people unemployed using functions from the {ggplot2} package. (5)

**2** With data in the simple feature data frame imported in question (1) above, compute the spatial autocorrelation of the percentage of people unemployed using the `moran()` function from the {spdep} package. Hint: First create a list of neighbors and weights using the `poly2nb()` and `nb2list2()` functions. (25)
