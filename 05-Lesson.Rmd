# Making graphs with functions from the {ggplot2} package

Principles and examples from my research.

The {ggplot2} package is a widely popular graphics tool among data scientists (including the New York Times and 538). It's popular because it is built on principles of good data visualization.

1.  Mapping data to aesthetics
2.  Layering
3.  Building plots step by step

We make the functions available to our current working directory by typing
```{r}
if(!require(ggplot2)) install.packages(pkgs = "ggplot2", repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")

library(ggplot2)
```

First principle: Map data to aesthetics

Consider the following numeric vectors (`foo`, `bar` and `zaz`). Create a data frame `df` using the `data.frame()` function.
```{r}
foo <- c(-122.419416,-121.886329,-71.05888,-74.005941,-118.243685,-117.161084,-0.127758,-77.036871,
         116.407395,-122.332071,-87.629798,-79.383184,-97.743061,121.473701,72.877656,2.352222,
         77.594563,-75.165222,-112.074037,37.6173)

bar <- c(37.77493,37.338208,42.360083,40.712784,34.052234,32.715738,51.507351,38.907192,39.904211,
         47.60621,41.878114,43.653226,30.267153,31.230416,19.075984,48.856614,12.971599,39.952584,
         33.448377,55.755826)

zaz <- c(6471,4175,3144,2106,1450,1410,842,835,758,727,688,628,626,510,497,449,419,413,325,318)

df <- data.frame(foo, bar, zaz)

head(df)
```

To make a scatter plot using {ggplot2} syntax, we use the `ggplot()` function. Note that the package name is {ggplot2} but the function is `ggplot()` (without the 2).

Inside the `ggplot()` function we specify the data frame with the `data =` argument. We specify what columns from the data frame are to be mapped to what 'aesthetics' with the `aes()` function using the `mapping =` argument. The `aes()` function can be nested inside the `ggplot()` function or inside a layer function.

For a scatter plot the aesthetics must include the x and y coordinates at a minimum, and for this example they are in the columns labeled `foo` and `bar` respectively.

Then, to render the scatter plot, we include the function `geom_point()` as a layer with the `+` symbol. Numeric values are specified using the arguments `x =` and `y =` in the `aes()` function and are rendered as points in a two-dimensional plane.
```{r}
ggplot(data = df, 
       mapping = aes(x = foo, y = bar)) +
  geom_point()
```

We map our data values to aesthetic attributes. The *points* in the scatter plot are geometric objects that get drawn. In {ggplot2} lingo, the points are *geoms*. More specifically, the points are point *geoms* that are denoted syntactically with the function `geom_point()`.

All geometric objects have aesthetic attributes (aesthetics):

-   x-position
-   y-position
-   color
-   size
-   transparency

When we visualize data using {ggplot2} syntax, we are creating a mapping between variables in our data frame and the aesthetic attributes of geometric objects. In the scatter plot we mapped `foo` to the x-position aesthetic and we mapped `bar` to the y-position aesthetic. This may seem trivial `foo` is the x-axis and `bar` is on the y-axis. We can do that in Excel.

But here there is a deeper structure. Theoretically, geometric objects (i.e., the things we draw in a plot, like points) don't just have attributes like position. They have a color, size, etc.

For example here we map a new variable to the size aesthetic.
```{r}
ggplot(data = df, 
       mapping = aes(x = foo, y = bar)) +
  geom_point(aes(size = zaz))
```

We changed a scatter plot to a bubble chart by mapping a new variable to the size aesthetic. Any visualization we see can be deconstructed into *geom* specifications and mapping from data to the aesthetic attributes of the geometric objects.

Second principle: Build plots in layers

The principle of layering is important. To create good visualizations we often need to:

-   Plot multiple datasets, or
-   Plot a dataset with additional contextual information contained in a second dataset, or
-   Plot summaries or statistical transformations over the raw data

Let's modify the bubble chart by getting additional data and plotting it as a new layer below the bubbles. First get the data from the {maps} package using the `map_data()` function and specifying the name of the map (here `"World"`) and assigning it to a data frame with the name `df2`.
```{r}
if(!require(maps)) install.packages(pkgs = "maps", repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
library(maps)

library(tidyverse)

df2 <- map_data(map = "world") %>%
  glimpse()
```

Plot the new data as a new layer underneath the bubbles.
```{r}
ggplot(data = df, 
       aes(x = foo, y = bar)) +
  geom_polygon(data = df2, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group)) +
  geom_point(aes(size = zaz), color = "red")
```

This is the same bubble chart but now with a new layer added. We transformed a bubble chart into a new visualization called a "dot distribution map," which is more insightful and visually interesting.

The bubble chart is a modified scatter plot and the dot distribution map is a modified bubble chart.

We used two of the data visualization principles (mapping & layering) to build this plot:

-   To create the scatter plot, we mapped `foo` to the x-aesthetic and mapped `bar` to the y-aesthetic
-   To create the bubble chart, we mapped a `zaz` to the size-aesthetic
-   To create the dot distribution map, we added a layer of polygon data under the bubbles.

Third principle: Iteration (step by step)

The third principle is about process. The process begins with mapping and layering but ends with iteration when we add layers that modify scales, legends, colors, etc. The syntax of `ggplot` *layerability* enables and rewards iteration.

Instead of plotting the result of the above code for making a bubble chart, let's assign the result to an object called `p1`. Coping/paste the code from above then include the assignment operator `p1 <-`.
```{r}
p1 <- ggplot(data = df, 
             mapping = aes(x = foo, y = bar)) +
        geom_polygon(data = df2, 
                     mapping = aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group)) +
        geom_point(aes(size = zaz), color = "red")
```

Now we can modify the axes labels saving the new plot to an object called `p2`.
```{r}
( p2 <- p1 + xlab("Longitude") + ylab("Latitude") )
```

Next we modify the scale label.
```{r}
p2 + scale_size_continuous(name = "Venture Capital Investment\n(USD, Millions)\n")
```

Of course we can do this all together with
```{r}
p1 + xlab("Longitude") + 
     ylab("Latitude") +
     scale_size_continuous(name = "Venture Capital Investment\n(USD, Millions)\n")
```

The `facet_wrap()` function is a layer to iterate (repeat) the entire plot conditional on another variable. It is like the `group_by()` function in the data grammar.

## Example 1: US tornadoes

Consider the tornado records in the file `Tornadoes.csv`. Import the data using the `read_csv()` function then create new columns called `Year`, `Month` and `EF` using the `mutate()` function.
```{r}
library(tidyverse)

( Torn.df <- read_csv(file = "Tornadoes.csv") %>%
  mutate(Year = yr,
         Month = as.integer(mo),
         EF = mag) )
```

Next create a data frame (`df`) containing the number of tornadoes by year for the state of Kansas.
```{r}
( df <- Torn.df %>%
  filter(st == "KS") %>%
  group_by(Year) %>%
  summarize(nT = n()) )
```

Then use the functions from the {ggplot2} package to plot the number of tornadoes by year using a lines to connect the values in order of the variable on the x-axis. 
```{r}
ggplot(data = df,
       mapping = aes(x = Year, y = nT)) +
  geom_line()
```

Note: In the early production stage of my research, I like to break the code into steps as above: (1) Import the data, (2) manipulate the data, and (3) plot the data. It is easier to document but it also introduces the potential for mistakes because of the various objects in the environment (e.g., `Torn.df`, `df`). 

We can merge the above code to create the time series of Kansas tornado frequency without creating these intermediary objects.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
read_csv(file = "Tornadoes.csv") %>%
  mutate(Year = yr,
         Month = as.integer(mo),
         EF = mag) %>%
  filter(st == "KS") %>%
  group_by(Year) %>%
  summarize(nT = n()) %>%
ggplot(mapping = aes(x = Year, y = nT)) +
  geom_line()
```

Recall that the `group_by()` function allows us to repeat an operation depending on the value (or level) of some variable. For example to count the number of tornadoes by EF damage rating since 2007 and ignoring missing ratings
```{r}
Torn.df %>%
  filter(Year >= 2007, EF != -9) %>%
  group_by(EF) %>%
  summarize(Count = n()) 
```

The result is a table listing the number of tornadoes grouped by EF rating.

Instead of printing the table, we create a bar chart using the `geom_col()` function.
```{r}
Torn.df %>%
  filter(Year >= 2007, EF != -9) %>%
  group_by(EF) %>%
  summarize(Count = n()) %>%
ggplot(mapping = aes(x = EF, y = Count)) +
  geom_col()
```

The `geom_bar()` function counts the number of cases at each x position so we don't need the `group_by()` and `summarize()` functions.
```{r}
Torn.df %>%
  filter(Year >= 2007, EF != -9) %>%
ggplot(mapping = aes(x = EF)) +
  geom_bar()
```

To improve the bar chart and to make it ready for publication.
```{r}
Torn.df %>%
  filter(Year >= 2007, EF != -9) %>%
  group_by(EF) %>%
  summarize(Count = n()) %>%
ggplot(mapping = aes(x = factor(EF), y = Count, fill = Count)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  xlab("EF Rating") + 
  ylab("Number of Tornadoes") +
  scale_fill_continuous(low = 'green', high = 'orange') +
  geom_text(aes(label = Count), vjust = -.5, size = 3) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = 'none') 
```

With the `facet_wrap()` function we can plot a series of bar charts showing the frequency of tornadoes by EF rating for each year since 2004. We add the function after the `geom_bar()` layer and use the formula syntax (`~ Year`) inside the parentheses. We interpret the syntax as "plot the bar chart *conditional* on year".
```{r}
Torn.df %>%
  filter(Year >= 2004, EF != -9) %>%
ggplot(mapping = aes(x = factor(EF))) +
  geom_bar() +
  facet_wrap(~ Year)
```

## Example 2: Hot days in Tallahassee and Las Vegas

The data are from the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC). They are [daily data](http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datasets) from the National Weather Service Forecast Office in Tallahassee. The observing site is the Tallahassee International Airport (previously the Tallahassee Municipal Airport and Tallahassee Regional Airport).

Import the data.
```{r}
TLH.df <- read_csv(file = "http://myweb.fsu.edu/jelsner/temp/data/TLH_DailySummary.csv",
                     na = "-9999")
```

The warning concerns the column labeled `TOBS`. By default the column type is logical but there are cases when the values are numbers. This can be ignored safely.

The variable of interest is the daily high temperature in the column labeled `TMAX`. The values are in tens of degrees C so the value of 128 is 12.8 C.

Mutate to add new columns giving the temperatures (daily maximum and daily minimum) in degrees F (original measuring unit) and the dates in calendar days. Select only the date and maximum and minimum temperature columns.
```{r}
TLH.df <- TLH.df %>%
  mutate(TmaxF = round(9/5 * TMAX/10 + 32),
         TminF = round(9/5 * TMIN/10 + 32),
         Date = as.Date(as.character(DATE), 
                        format = "%Y%m%d")) %>%
  select(Date, TmaxF, TminF) %>%
glimpse()
```

Note we use the `as.Date()` function ({base} see `?as.Date`). The format in the data file is a concatenation of a four-digit year, a two-digit month, and a two-digit day. Thus the format argument is `format = "%Y%m%d"`).

Q: Is it getting hotter in Tallahassee? Let's compute the annual average high temperature and create a time series graph.

We use the `year()` function from the {lubridate} package to get a column called `Year`, the `group_by()` function to group by `Year`, and the `summarize()` function from the {dplyr} package to get the average daily maximum temperature for each year.

```{r}
library(lubridate)

df <- TLH.df %>%
  mutate(Year = year(Date)) %>%
  group_by(Year) %>%
  summarize(AvgT = mean(TmaxF)) %>%
glimpse()
```

We now have a data frame with two columns: `Year` and `AvgT` (annual average daily high temperature in degrees F).

We now use functions from the {ggplot2} package to make a plot. We specify the x aesthetic as `Year` and the y aesthetic as the `AvgT`. We include a point layer and a line layer.
```{r}
ggplot(data = df, 
       mapping = aes(x = Year, y = AvgT)) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  geom_line() +
  ylab("Average Annual Temperature in Tallahassee, FL (F)")
```

Q: What's wrong? Fix and add a trend line layer. Here we go directly to the graph without saving the resulting data frame. That is, we pipe `%>%` the resulting data frame after applying the {dplyr} verbs to the `ggplot()` function. The object in the first argument of the `ggplot()` function is the result (data frame) from the code above.
```{r}
TLH.df %>%
  mutate(Year = year(Date)) %>%
  filter(Year < 2014) %>%
  group_by(Year) %>%
  summarize(AvgT = mean(TmaxF)) %>%
ggplot(mapping = aes(x = Year, y = AvgT)) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  geom_line() +
  ylab("Average Annual Temperature in Tallahassee, FL (F)") +
  geom_smooth() +
  theme_minimal()
```

Q: Is the frequency of extremely hot days increasing over time? Let's consider a daily high temperature of 100 F and above as extremely hot.

Here we count the number of days at or above 100F using the `summarize()` function together with the `sum()` function on the logical operator `>=`. If a day is missing a high temperature, we remove it with the `na.rm = TRUE` argument in the `sum()` function.
```{r}
TLH.df %>%
  mutate(Year = year(Date)) %>%
  filter(Year < 2014) %>%
  group_by(Year) %>%
  summarize(N100 = sum(TmaxF >= 100, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
ggplot(mapping = aes(x = Year, y = N100, fill = N100)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity') + 
  scale_fill_continuous(low = 'orange', high = 'red') +
  geom_text(aes(label = N100), vjust = 1.5, size = 3) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1950, 2013, 10)) +
  ylab(expression(paste("Number of days in Tallahassee, FL at or above 100", {}^o, " F"))) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x  = element_text(size = 11), legend.position = "none")
```

How does a histogram of daily high temperatures look?
```{r}
gTLH <- ggplot(data = TLH.df, 
               mapping = aes(x = TmaxF)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, aes(fill = ..count..)) +
  scale_fill_continuous(low = 'green', high = 'blue') +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(30, 120)) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 1000)) +
  ylab("Number of Days") + 
  xlab(expression(paste("Daily High Temperature in Tallahassee, FL (", {}^o, " F)"))) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

Q: The most common high temperatures are in the low 90s, but there are relatively few 100+ days. Why?

Compare the histogram of daily high temperatures in Tallahassee with a histogram of daily high temperatures in Las Vegas, Nevada. Here we repeat the code above but for the data frame `LVG.df`. We then use the operators from the {patchwork} package to plot them side by side.
```{r}
LVG.df <- read_csv(file = "http://myweb.fsu.edu/jelsner/temp/data/LV_DailySummary.csv",
                     na = "-9999")

LVG.df <- LVG.df %>%
  mutate(TmaxF = round(9/5 * TMAX/10 + 32),
         TminF = round(9/5 * TMIN/10 + 32),
         Date = as.Date(as.character(DATE), 
                        format = "%Y%m%d")) %>%
  select(Date, TmaxF, TminF)

gLVG <- ggplot(data = LVG.df, 
               mapping = aes(x = TmaxF)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, aes(fill = ..count..)) +
  scale_fill_continuous(low = 'green', high = 'blue') +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(30, 120)) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 1000)) +
  ylab("Number of Days") + 
  xlab(expression(paste("Daily High Temperature in Las Vegas, NV (", {}^o, " F)"))) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")

## Example 3: US population and area by state

The object `us_states` from the {spData} package is a data frame from the U.S. Census Bureau. The variables include the state `GEOID` and `NAME`, the `REGION` (`South`, `West`, etc), `AREA` (in square km), and total population in 2010 (`total_pop_10`) and in 2015 (`total_pop_15`).
```{r}
library(sf)
library(spData)

class(us_states)
head(us_states)
```

The object `us_states` has two classes: simple feature and data frame. It is a data frame that has spatial information stored in the column labeled `geometry`. More about this next lesson.

Note also that the variable `AREA` is numeric with units (km\^2). Thus in order to perform some operations we need to specify units. For example, if we want to filter by area keeping only states with an area greater than 500,000 square km we need to use `set_units()` from the {units} package.
```{r}
us_states %>% 
  filter(AREA > units::set_units(500000, km^2))
```

For now, suppose we want to plot area versus population for each state including state names on the plot. We note large differences between the minimum and maximum values for both variables.
```{r}
us_states %>%
  summarize(rA = range(AREA),
            rP = range(total_pop_15))
```

Let's start with a simple scatter plot using logarithmic scales. The variable `AREA` has units so we convert it to a numeric with the `as.numeric()` function.
```{r}
ggplot(data = us_states,
       mapping = aes(x = as.numeric(AREA),
                     y = total_pop_15)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_log10() +
  scale_y_log10()
```

Next we use the {scales} package so the tic labels can be expressed in whole numbers with commas.
```{r}
library(scales)

ggplot(data = us_states,
       mapping = aes(x = as.numeric(AREA),
                     y = total_pop_15)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_log10(labels = comma) +
  scale_y_log10(labels = comma)
```

Next we add text labels. We can do this with `geom_text()` or `geom_label()`
```{r}
ggplot(data = us_states,
       mapping = aes(x = as.numeric(AREA),
                     y = total_pop_15)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_text(aes(label = NAME)) +
  scale_x_log10(labels = comma) +
  scale_y_log10(labels = comma)
```

The labels are centered on top of the points. To fix this we use functions from the {grepel} package.
```{r}
library(ggrepel)

ggplot(data = us_states,
       mapping = aes(x = as.numeric(AREA),
                     y = total_pop_15)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_text_repel(aes(label = NAME)) +
  scale_x_log10(labels = comma) +
  scale_y_log10(labels = comma)
```

Finally, since the data object is a simple feature data frame we can make a map.
```{r}
ggplot(us_states) + 
  geom_sf(aes(fill = total_pop_15)) +
  scale_fill_continuous(labels = comma)
```
